# Stefan L. Smith

## Violinist | Violist | Composer | Educator

Welcome to my new website which is currently under construction. 

A little information about myself:

I am a professional violinist, composer and violist in the Los Angeles area. I currently am a member of the Hollywood Bowl Orchestra as well as a regular recording studio musician in Los Angeles. With over 15+ years teaching all different levels, I'm able to teach effectively and efficiently. Whether it is learning for the first time, coming back to the instrument, or advanced preparation, I'm able to help you reach the next level :)

Please contact me via the email provided below for more information regarding my: instruction rates, performance fees, commissions and all other inquires.
